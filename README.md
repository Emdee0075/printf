# Welcome to My Printf
The my_printf() function produce output according to a format as described below. The my_printf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream;

This function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted to output.

## Task
The task was to create a custom `printf` function from scratch. The challenge lay in understanding the intricacies of variable argument lists, string manipulation, and formatting according to different specifiers.

## Description
This custom `printf` function, `my_printf`, is designed to mimic the standard `printf` function's behavior. It handles various format specifiers such as `%d`, `%o`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%c`, `%s`, and `%p`. The implementation focuses on the correct parsing of format strings and the efficient conversion of input arguments into their respective string representations.


## Installation
To install this project, clone the repository and compile the source files using `make`:
git clone [your-repository-link]
cd [your-repository-directory]

## Usage
To use the `my_printf` function in your code, include the header file `my_printf.h` and call the function just like you would with the standard `printf`.
